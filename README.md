# Simple e-commerce API including blog services.

## What is E-Commerce Blog API?
This project is supposed to be an API only for the e-commerce blog API.
We will be serving products like:
1. Bags (Men and Women)
2. Watches (Men, Unisex, and Women)
3. Clothing (Men and Women)
4. Jewellery (Men and Women)
5. Shoes (Men and Women)
6. Makeup supplies (Men and Women)

## Getting started.
The project is an idea that I came up with after my own extensive research on businesses that really work well in the current times.


## How to contribute?
Currently, It will be just the two of us. I have no idea about how docker and vault works. I’m only aware of JWT but even for it’s implementation It’s safe to say that you can initiate the setup. I really wish to make use of Express, Postgresql, and sequelize (ORM), stripe for payment gateway.
